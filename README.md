This script will build and compile Suyu for macOS on Apple Silicon.

> [!WARNING]
> This script is provided for experimentation purposes.<br> 
> Don't expect high compatibility, there are reasons why parent project to Suyu didn't get official Mac build.<br>


#### Get it by pressing the button below or via [Releases](https://github.com/mavethee/suyu-macos-builds-script/releases) page :)

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.0.9-brightgreen)](https://github.com/mavethee/suyu-macos-builds-script/releases/download/0.0.9/build_suyu.sh)

## Usage:

After downloading, double click the script and follow the prompts.

It is advised to run it from your home directory.

#### You can check current macOS compatibility with apps and homebrews [here](./assets/compatibility/compatibility.md).

> [!NOTE]
> On a base M1, building takes ~6mins (measured including gathering needed dependencies which differs depending on your internet speed)
> In case of any permission issues, run:
> ```
> chmod +x ./build_suyu.sh
> ```
>
> Suyu currently does not support a lot of required features.<br>
> If a game you are trying to play uses these features, it will crash. <br>
> If you want to know what missing feature is causing the crash, run Suyu through Terminal:
>
> ```
> /Applications/suyu.app/Contents/MacOS/suyu
> ```
>
> You can also find a generated log file in `~/.local/share/suyu/log/suyu_log.txt`!
>
> The situation will get better in the future as MoltenVK adds support for more features.
